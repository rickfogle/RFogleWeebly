This project was created with three goals in mind.
1. As a learning exercise to help me learn Java programming.
2. To help me come up to speed on using the Selenium test automation tool by writing scripts to test my
personal website at http://www.rfogle.weebly.com

As a consequence of needing to keep my source code available from any of the several places that I might be able to 
sit and write code from, I am also learning to use GIT.
